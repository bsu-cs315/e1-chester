Game Instructions:
+ Control the angle of the cannon using W and S
+ Control the power of the projectile using A and D
+ Fire the projectile using the Space Bar

## Activity Report:

Essential Goals
+ Controls: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired and can fire it, the projectile's path is affected by the physics engine's gravity, and there is a ground that stops the projectile's falling. - COMPLETED
+ Licenses: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the repository, and you have satisfied all license requirements. - COMPLETED
+ Version control: The repository is properly configured, including an appropriate .gitignore, no unnecessary files tracked, a single mainline branch called master or main, and in the course organization. Commits follow Beams' rules. - COMPLETED
+ Release Management: You have made a release on GitHub and tagged it using semantic versioning. - COMPLETED
+ Report: The report is complete as described in the first week's exercise. - COMPLETED
  
Auxillary Goals:
+ Instructions for playing the game are given either in the game and/or in the README.md file. - COMPLETED
+ The projectile's angle is clamped between 0° and 180°. - COMPLETED
+ There is a non-ground target that the player can hit, and you have scripted specific feedback for hitting it. - COMPLETED
+ The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing. - COMPLETED

## Revision Report

Game Instructions:
+ Control the angle of the cannon using W and S
+ Control the power of the projectile using A and D
+ Fire the projectile using the Space Bar

## Activity Report:

Essential Goals
+ Graphics: The game uses imported graphics for the projectile, target, background, and ground. - COMPLETED
+ Sounds: The game plays a sound (.wav) when the projectile is launched. - COMPLETED
+ One at a time: The player has a limited inventory of projectiles, and only one can be launched and active at a time. - COMPLETED
+ Licenses: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the repository, and you have satisfied all license requirements. - COMPLETED
+ Version control: The repository is properly configured, including an appropriate .gitignore, no unnecessary files tracked, a single mainline branch called master or main, and in the course organization. Commits follow Beams' rules. - COMPLETED
+ Release Management: You have made a release on GitHub and tagged it using semantic versioning. - COMPLETED
+ Report: The report is complete as described in the first week's exercise. - COMPLETED
